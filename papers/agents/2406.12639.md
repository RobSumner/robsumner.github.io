# Aks-before-Plan: Proactive Language Agents for Real-World Planning (2024)

[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12639)

## Summary

This paper proposes a new task called Proactive Agent Planning, which requires agents to predict clarification needs from environment observations and use external tools to collect information.

## Details

### Problem

Agents can struggle when the user request isn't specific enough, or the environment state is lacking required context. This paper's main contributions for this problem are:

- Proposes a new problem class of "Proactive Agent Planning" where tasks are deliberately unclear.
- Propose a multi-agent approach CEP where three different agents have distinct roles.
  - The "clarification" role (predicting when instructions are uncertain).
  - The "execution" role (using external tools to get more information from the environment for the clarification agent).
  - The "planning" role (produces the final plan from the clarification process).
- Constructs a dataset for studying this problem called "Ask-before-Plan".
  - This is built from a set of well defined task descriptions with all information, collected from the `TravelPlanner` environment.
  - Details are removed to give under-defined tasks.
  - Unfeasible details are added to produce over-defined tasks.
